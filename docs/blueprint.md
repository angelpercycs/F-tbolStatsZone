## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Saturated cobalt blue (#3D5AFE), inspired by the intensity and focus of the game, suggesting reliability and importance, yet differentiating from more commonplace sporting colors like red, black, or green.
- Background color: Near-black charcoal (#121212), very dark to provide the requested dark mode feel, and close in hue to the blue.
- Accent color: A light-blue grey (#A7C4FF), for the headings, to pop against the cobalt-and-charcoal foundation of the site
- Font: 'Inter', a sans-serif typeface. This provides a clean, neutral, and legible design for displaying match data.
- Clear tab navigation to switch between 'Daily Matches' and 'By Round' views.
- Use simple icons for different sports, countries, and match statuses.
